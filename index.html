To start blogging, you can look up websites that help you create your own blog. Choose a topic of your choice and take references from popular blogs to understand how to go about it. Practise writing on a daily basis to improve your speed and share your blogs with people who can help you improve your style in a better way. Bloggers and content writers can earn a good sum of money just by sitting at home and writing for different clients.

                You don’t need a DSLR to shoot great photos. If you’re sitting at home doing nothing, use your phone to start clicking pictures of things around you. You can experiment with photography techniques. Start your own Instagram page that displays your photography. You can capture scenes of food, nature or even people for that matter. It can be a good freelance hobby and will help in nurturing your creative bent of mind for lucrative job opportunities.
